# Course title: Introduction to Java Programming

These files contain the java code of a university assignment in which I used the model-view-controller model to code a computer application in which a user can navigate in and out of various rooms using arrow buttons and collect and drop various items in those rooms. The application was written in Java using the IDE Eclipse and the interface was built using SceneBuilder, a visual layout tool which I was unfamiliar with but quickly became relatively proficient in.
